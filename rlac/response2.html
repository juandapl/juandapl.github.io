                Literature review is a pain for everyone. At least, that is what I would like to think when I have to
                make
                myself aware of all there is to know about a very specific area of knowledge I, as the result of a
                combination of chance and bad planning, find myself in the unenviable task of writing an
                essay on. It is, in general, a very stressful task. Having this in mind, <a
                    href="https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/rlac-fall21-sa">Sarah</a> and I used <a
                    href="https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antcorgen/">AntCorGen</a>
                to build a corpus of 111 articles from the <a
                    href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/static/publish">PLOS
                    ONE database</a> and review literature on the
                exact opposite feeling: studies about relaxation psychology. With this corpus in hand, we then
                experimented
                with word frequency analysis to extract as much information as possible from this field <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laziness">without actually
                    having to read any of the articles</a>.

                The first thing to do when analysing a new corpus is to take a look at the aggregated word counts. After
                filtering through commonly used words using <a href="https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280">this
                    stoplist</a>, and ignoring other common words in
                scientific papers, we find some interesting occurrences among the top words:

                We can infer the most popular lines of research in relaxation studies from this list: we can hypothesise
                that most studies on relaxation will either deal with the use of music (#6), or interventions (#38) for
                the relief of pain, stress, and anxiety (#28-29-30), or the use of techniques like meditation (#77) and
                ASMR (#202) to reduce stress levels. As for the methods used, questionnaires (#133) are highlighted as a
                common research practice.

            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                In order to see if these high-frequency words are really a trend in relaxation studies or only heavily
                used in one article, we use AntConc’s concordance plot function. In this specific case, we aren’t really
                looking for high density areas in the corpus for these words, but rather for the percentage of papers in
                which they are mentioned.

            <p class="bodytext">
                With this knowledge, we can be a bit more precise about our hypothesis: we can see that as ASMR is only
                present in one of the articles, it does not represent a popular field of study within relaxation
                psychology. We can also see that “music”, although the sixth most frequently used word in the corpus,
                only appears in 26% of the articles, possibly meaning that it is not a technique central to all studies
                about relaxation, but is the centre of discussion in a branch of the corpus. The same could be said
                about “pain”: although its appearances in the corpus are better-distributed than those of “music”.

                “stress”, “anxiety”, and “intervention”, being well-distributed but less frequent words, could be

                lines of inquiry on their own. The same could be said about “questionnaire”: we can infer from its
                presence in 66% of the articles that it is one of the preferred methods to gather data in this
                discipline.

                From the top clusters containing “music” in the corpus we can infer that there are a set of variables
                that are controlled during the study of relaxing music: there seems to be research on whether tempo
                (“fast-tempo” or “slow-tempo”), style (“genre”, “classical”), or other subjective characteristics
                (“arousing”) have an impact on the effectiveness of music for relaxation. According to our cluster list,
                one of the benchmarks used to measure relaxation appears to be its use as a sleep aid (#27).

                (“intensity”, “tolerance”, “score”), which we can suppose are part of relaxation psychology in order to
                provide a method of measuring the effectiveness of relaxation techniques.

                By looking at different perspectives on word counts and collocates, we were able to infer what the main
                lines of inquiry in relaxation psychology are, the variables these studies take into account, and some
                of the methods they use to achieve their results. This kind of surface reading served as a kind of
                overview of the knowledge currently available on this area, and similar methods could be applied (of
                course, with more rigour) to do broad literature reviews for specific fields. However, this has its
                limitations: for example, scientific databases are often paywalled and often open-source ones might not
                have a representative sample of the breadth of a field, making it more difficult to confidently infer
                conclusions than with say, a limited corpus of an author’s works or online content such as fanfiction or
                social media posts.
