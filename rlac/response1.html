            <p class="bodytext">This written response is the result of an exploration of a corpus of <a

                    Asian colonial literature (by Amardeep Singh)</a> using the corpus analysis tool <a
                    href="https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/">AntConc.</a> It is also a reflection on
                the ideas of nation, race, and caste of two authors on opposite sides of the Indian colonial ethnic
                spectrum. It is also, if the reader allows a bit of speculation and overinduction, a glimpse at the
                different thematic possibilities available from the same land to people of separate contexts.</p>

            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Out of the numerous authors contained in the corpus, I thought it would be a good idea to
                contrast the most common topics and choices of authors on both sides of the colonial divide: the
                coloniser and the colonised. Because of their relative prominence, I chose to contrast <a
                    href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/rabindranath-tagore">Rabindranath
                    Tagore</a> and <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/rudyard-kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>
                in order to explore the relationship between the context
                of the authors and the way they describe the composition of society and their characters’ roles in it.

                My first stop in this analysis was AntConc’s word list tool. I used <a
                    href="https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280">this stoplist from NLTK</a> to
                filter most function words. The first uncommon words to appear in the top of the wordlist (aside from
                the names of the main characters) are in both authors the titles with which the characters are
                addressed. In the case of Kipling, this is the word “sahib”, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahib">a word used in colonial India to address
                    high-ranking English officials or landowners</a>, while in the case of Tagore it is “brahmo”, <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmo">the title
                    given to the members of Tagore’s Hindu sect</a>, or “babu”, a title for elders.

            <p class="bodytext">
                The prominence of Sahibs and Brahmos can be confirmed by using AntConc’s Keyword List tool, which
                compares the word frequencies of a corpus to another reference corpus. For each of the two authors, I
                used the works of the other as reference corpus, enabling me to see the words frequently used by one
                author but not by the other.

                With this information, we can hypothesise that a good amount of the characters in both authors’ books
                are based on people of their ethnicity and social status. We can also look at the word clusters that
                contain “sahib” and “brahmo” and see that, in fact, we can obtain a list of main characters. We can also
                see, using these results and the Word List tool, what proportion of the main characters in both authors
                belong to these groups.

                Tagore’s main characters appear associated with the title “brahmo”, a fact from which we can
                hypothesise that some of Tagore's main characters are from the same sector of society as him, or
                interact with people from it.

                In the case of Kipling, although only two of the main characters are associated with the title
                of “sahib” (Tarvin and Kim), “sahib” is still collocated to many proper names of what could be
                supporting characters, which could mean that many of Kipling’s characters are based on other English
                people in India.

                A deeper look at the keywords tool led me to find more words used to categorise people. This could give

                two authors in regards to this, I also calculated the ratio of use of the words they use for these

                aren’t either names of characters or titles. We can hypothesise that skin colour is a defining feature

                Running the cluster tool on these words backs up our hypothesis: in the most frequent clusters

                In Tagore, on the other hand, these descriptors are rarely used. This could mean that, in his work,
                society is divided in a different way. Running the keywords tool on Tagore’s works gives us a completely
                different classification of society: showing us titles that denote distinctions within what in Kipling
                is just “the natives”: “babu” (#4), “brahmo” (#14), and “rani” (#38) appear along the character names in
                the top of the list of keywords, which bears barely any mention of adjectives for the distinct ethnic

                This exercise let me see what word frequencies can tell us about the assumptions and the cultural
                context behind a text. Also, analysing these frequencies can be used to obtain a fairly accurate
                estimate of the “what?” and the “who?” of large volumes of text. For example, we just discussed the
                distribution of main characters throughout the corpus, how they are described, and attempted to relate
                their characteristics to the individual contexts of the two authors. However, the “why?” remains
                slightly unclear with this kind of distant reading: is encountering different distributions of
                racially-charged words a sign of a hidden intent by the author? Or is it a reflection of their context?
                Or, more interestingly, have I, knowing that <a

                get rid of it?
