                In this piece, we analyse the differences between the choices made in two sets of works of science
                fiction set in similar contexts from two different authors. We ask ourselves whether the differences in
                the personal circumstances of our authors is reflected in how they reinterpret the core concept that
                spans their works, and whether such a conclusion can even be reached by looking at limited variables
                such as their gender and their historical period.

            <p class="bodytext">
                We chose the common topic of the encounter between humans and aliens in the books Enchantress of Venus
                (1949) and Black Amazon of Mars (1951), from female writer Leigh Brackett, and compared them to Brigands
                of the Moon (1931) and War Nymphs of Venus (1941), from male writer Ray Cummings. A <a

                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13402303-black-amazon-of-mars">reading</a> of

                    books</a> lets us infer that they share the common motif of human explorers
                finding
                themselves outside of Earth battling groups of aliens, however, given
                the different gender identities of
                the authors and the almost twenty-year difference between their works,
                we can hypothesize that the way
                they characterise their heroes, and their violent encounters with
                extraterrestrials differs similarly.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                To explore this, we looked into how the books’ characters are gendered and what qualities are usually
                associated with these genders in both authors, and we performed sentiment analysis with the intent of
                having a sense of the development of the plot and try to establish whether it is significantly different
                between the authors. From this initial exploration, we decided to delve deeper into the authors’
                descriptions of war and the differences in their word usage.

            <p class="bodytext">
                We then performed two kinds of sentiment analysis on the corpus in order to make some inferences about
                the plot development of each of the books. We first used the <a
                    href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/6010-full.html">afinn</a> lexicon to assign a sentiment
                        score ranging from -5 (very negative), to 5 (very positive) and added these scores across
                        100-line
                        sectors of each one of the books. The results can be seen in this plot:
            </p>
            <br>

                Plot of sentiment score (positive-negative) per sector of the books. [This is an interactive graph. Hover over it to see the values.]
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                We can observe that all of the plots show an overwhelming concentration of negative words throughout
                their length, which to us might be a consequence of the high frequency of words used to describe the
                violent encounters between humans and aliens, and that words describing combat are ranked negatively in
                the afinn lexicon. However, we can notice that all the books seem to be organised in a series of
                negative spikes, which we think can mean that the books are composed of many short but rapidly
                intensifying violent segments. As we didn’t find any clear differences between the two authors, we
                decided to use the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">nrc</a> lexicon to
                        pair every word in our corpus with an emotion (anger,
                        anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust) and count these emotions per
                        100-line
                        sectors in order to obtain a plot summary in terms of emotions.

            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Using this visualisation, we can try to confirm our suspicions about the nature of the negative words in
                the corpus. In Cummings, words relating to “disgust”, “joy”, and “surprise” are not common, instead
                being words related to “fear” the most frequent throughout the length of the books. We can identify
                again the spikes in conflict in the books through increased frequencies of words related to “anger”,
                “anticipation”, and “sadness” and the lulls between these spikes through larger amounts of “trust”
                words.

            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                In Brackett, similarly, “fear” is a prevalent sentiment in both books, and “joy”, “surprise”, and
                “disgust” are, too, rather infrequent. However, the spikes in conflict are represented only by an
                increase in “anger” and “sadness”, not “anticipation”, and words related to “trust” have a seemingly
                constant frequency throughout the books.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                We can first observe that “trust” is constant in Brackett, while only appearing outside of conflict in
                Cummings. We could infer that in Brackett there is a partnership in combat between multiple characters,
                which can explain why “trust” appears even in the violent spikes of her books, while, on the contrary,
                we could infer that Cummings prefers to place a lone “hero” character in violent sections of his books,
                given the lack of words pertaining to “trust” during the peaks in “anticipation” and “anger”. Another
                difference is the lack of words related to “anticipation” in Brackett’s peaks of “anger” compared to
                Cummings’, which could mean a difference in how they portray conflict.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="bodytext">
                Our last observation is about the endings of the works. Given that not all words are counted as
                pertaining to an emotion by the nrc lexicon, we can assume that the thicker parts of our streamgraphs
                correspond to sectors of the story with a larger emotional load. We can notice that Cummings’ endings
                are noticeably more emotionally charged than the rest of the books, while Brackett’s books end in levels
                of emotion similar to the other parts. We could infer from this that Cummings prefers grand endings,
                while the climax of Brackett’s books happens slightly before the ending.
